# Chapter One: Introduction

“Contact finds. Circumstances intervene.”

The galaxy sprawls in every direction—ancient, chaotic, and endlessly inventive. Most civilizations rise and fall within their own stars, building empires, waging wars, and dreaming of transcendence. The Culture does not rule them, but it watches. It listens. And when the situation demands it—when suffering spreads or power curdles into atrocity—it acts.

That action often falls to Special Circumstances.
 They are not soldiers, not diplomats, and not entirely spies. They are the instruments the Culture employs when simple contact isn’t enough—when ethics meet reality and reality doesn’t blink. They are interventionists, manipulators, problem-solvers, and sometimes monsters in the service of mercy.

A Special Circumstances mission is never routine. You and your teammates may be human, drone, Mind, or something in between—each of you a fragment of the Culture’s will, carrying its ideals into places that have never heard of it, or wish they never had. Together, you operate in the thin line between morality and necessity, guided by reason, haunted by conscience.

Every campaign is a case file—a tour of duty in a sector where the Culture’s quiet hand must move. It might begin as a simple negotiation with an emerging power, a rescue of a stranded Mind, or an observation mission gone wrong. But each file, inevitably, spirals outward: secrets revealed, alliances broken, and the line between manipulation and compassion blurring until you are no longer sure which side of it you stand on.

## Turns

Once your agents are assembled and the GM has prepared a case, play begins. If this is your first session, gather your dice, your notes, and whatever passes for a conscience. The GM will deliver the briefing—a summary of the situation, what’s at stake, and what Special Circumstances expects you to accomplish. After hearing the mission, each player writes a personal Goal for the session: an ambition, a principle, or a question your character hopes to answer. When the Goals are set, the GM’s Turn begins.

### The GM’s Turn

The GM opens play with their turn—the phase of pressure and consequence. Here, the GM’s job is not to destroy the agents but to test them: their competence, their judgment, and their conviction in the Culture’s ideals. Every decision, every action, should reveal something about who these operatives truly are when no one is watching.

The GM frames the situation, places the first obstacle in the agents’ path, and sets events in motion. The first challenge should threaten the mission’s success or the team’s principles. From then on, tension escalates. There is no safety net, no convenient pause. Each choice ripples outward, complicating the next.

Obstacles might be social, political, or physical. Some are resolved with a single test; others unfold through interlocking challenges. Success means you achieve your intent—though the GM may still describe unintended consequences. Failure always drives the narrative forward. When you fail, the GM introduces a twist—a new complication, an unforeseen shift in allegiance, or a subtle fracture in trust—or imposes a condition, a cost you must bear to continue.

The GM’s Turn ends when the case reaches a natural break: the team completes or abandons its mission, reaches a point of safety, or earns downtime between operations. Then control passes to the players.

### The Players’ Turn

The Players’ Turn gives your agents space to breathe—if that’s the right word. Here, you recover, reflect, rebuild, and prepare for what’s next. You might debrief with a supervising Mind, negotiate favors, upgrade your drone companion, or explore personal entanglements left unresolved by the mission.

All actions in the Players’ Turn must be purchased with Hero Tokens, a shared meta-currency earned during the GM’s Turn by embracing risk, moral conflict, and self-inflicted trouble. The more your characters let their flaws, ideals, and beliefs complicate their mission, the more opportunities you’ll have to act freely later.

## Intervention Tokens

Intervention Tokens are a shared pool of meta-currency representing the collective momentum of the team—the blend of brilliance, nerve, and moral compromise that lets a Special Circumstances cell survive its own decisions. They track not only luck, but also leverage: how much narrative and ethical pressure the group can exert before the galaxy pushes back.

Every agent contributes to and draws from this pool. When one of you acts boldly, the team as a whole benefits. When one of you falters or sacrifices, that risk empowers everyone else. In the end, Intervention Tokens measure how far your crew can bend circumstance before it breaks.

### Earning Intervention Tokens

Tokens are earned whenever the group leans into uncertainty, embraces character flaws, or fulfills the letter—or the spirit—of their mission. They accumulate in a shared pool accessible to all players.

You gain Credits when any of the following occur:

* Accepting Setbacks: Taking a –1D penalty on any test during the GM’s Turn because of a Trait earns 1 token.
* Empowering the Opposition: Granting an opponent +2D before the GM rolls on a versus test because of a PC's Trait earns 2 tokens.
* Conceding a Tie: Choosing to break a versus test tie in the opponent’s favor earns 2 tokens. This doesn't need to be related to a Trait.
* Living Your Beliefs: Playing out a Belief in a meaningful way earns up to 1 token per session.
* Pursuing Goals: Accomplishing a Goal earns 2 tokens per session. Striving toward a Goal but failing to achieve it still earns 1 token.
* Most Valuable Prompts: At the end of the session, the group creates prompts to illustrate future sessions.  Each prompt whose image is incorporated to the game's slides earns 1 token to the pool.

### Spending Tokens

Any player may spend from the shared pool when the squad needs an edge. Tokens can be used in the following ways:

* Actions in Downtime: Spending 1 token grants a test during the Players’ Turn.
* Emergency Recovery: Spending 2 tokens during the GM’s Turn allows a character to use a test to recover, patch up, or regain footing in the middle of a mission. This cannot be used mid-conflict.
* Exploding Sixes: After rolling, spending 1 token allows you to reroll all dice that came up 6. See the Overcoming Obstacles chapter for more details.
* Boosting Rolls: Before rolling, you may spend tokens to add +1D per token, up to a maximum of +2D.

# Chapter Two: Character Creation

Every agent of Special Circumstances is a convergence of origins, experiences, and choices—someone shaped as much by the culture that made them as by the missions that broke or refined them. They did not begin as operatives; they were engineers, diplomats, artists, or soldiers—citizens whose paths bent toward the ambiguous work of intervention.

Character creation is the process of tracing that trajectory. It defines where your character came from, what shaped their ethics and capabilities, and how they came to serve in the quiet, often uncomfortable role of a Special Circumstances field agent. It reveals not just their skills, but their contradictions: what they value, what they fear, and what lines they might cross when ideals collide with necessity.

This chapter will guide you through the following steps:

1. Choose a Homeworld
2. Choose an Upbringing
3. Select Lifepaths (your careers before the Guard)
4. Write Beliefs and Instincts
5. Forge Connections with your fellow PCs

---

## Trait Pairs

During character creation you will get Trait Pairs: two opposing qualities that live within your character. A Trait Pair is not a strict alignment; it is a tension, a spectrum, and a story hook. Both sides are true of your character, and play will reveal which side comes to the fore in a given moment. You cannot erase or ignore either half. Over time, play will reveal which side of the pair defines you more — but the other side will always remain a possibility, ready to resurface.

### Using Trait Pairs in Play

Helpful Trait: When your Trait would be able to help you or make things easier, you may invoke it to shape the fiction. This grants you +1D without spending a Hero Token. The GM should agree the Trait is genuinely helpful.

Harmful Trait: You, the GM, or another player may call on your Trait when it creates conflict, complication, or trouble. When this happens, the group gains a Hero Token — but you must play through the complication.

---

## Step One: Homeworld

Every character begins in a world — lush or barren, decadent or desperate. Your homeworld gives your character their first perspective on life among the stars.

Choose one and answer the prompt:

* Core World — Wealthy, stable, bureaucratic.
  Prompt: What privilege did you take for granted that others might resent?
* Frontier Colony — Harsh survival, scarce resources.
  Prompt: What danger almost killed you before adulthood?
* Trade Hub — A crossroads of cultures and species.
  Prompt: Which offworlder taught you something you still carry?
* Industrial World — Factories, shipyards, endless labor.
  Prompt: What skill or craft did you inherit from the machinery around you?
* Exotic World — Harsh alien ecology or unusual traditions.
  Prompt: What belief or adaptation sets you apart from the rest of the crew?

Mechanics: Your homeworld grants 2 points of Circles and 2 skill points.

---

## Step Two: Upbringing

Who raised you? Who shaped you before your career began?

Choose one and answer the prompt:

* Family — Kinship and obligation.
  Prompt: Whose expectations and bounds from your family still shape your choices?
* Institution — Monastery, academy, guild, or military school.
  Prompt: What lesson did they drill into you that you now resist?
* Street — Hustling, surviving, improvising.
  Prompt: Who did you betray to get by?
* Machine — Raised among robots, AIs, or cybernetic systems.
  Prompt: What part of humanity still feels alien to you?

Mechanics: Your upbringing grants three Skill points and a NPC relationship (an ally, rival, or mentor). You should also distribute 8 points between Will and Health; neither stat may have a rating lower than 2 or higher than 6.

---

## Step Three: Lifepaths

Your history is told through lifepaths — narrative chapters that shape you. Each lifepath gives:

* 3 skills points (to be distributed in up to 3 specific skills)
* A Prompt (story choices that tie you to the world and others)

The first and second lifepaths you take also gives you a pair of traits each.

Or create your own lifepath!

## Step Four: Write Beliefs and Instincts

After lifepaths, you define two guiding aspects of your character’s personality. These are not static rules — they are levers that pull your character into action and into conflict.

* Belief — A principle or conviction that drives your character. What do you believe is true about the world, and how does it shape your choices?“The lanes must be safe. The void must be watched. You are the last line.”
* Instinct — A reflex or habit you fall back on without hesitation. Instincts describe what you always do (or never do) when faced with a situation.

Goal

* When creating your character, you write a Belief and an Instinct. But your character is also shaped by their Goals: A concrete outcome your character seeks. Goals are immediate and situational, shifting as the story evolves. During play, you will write your Goal only after the GM has introduced the opening situation, so it ties directly to the adventure at hand.

# Chapter Three: Overcoming Obstacles

The airlock is jammed. Sparks shower from exposed wires while the emergency klaxon blares in your ears. Through the viewing port, you glimpse the dark curve of the asteroid spinning closer with every second. Your squad is shouting over comms, urging you to move, but the only way forward is to get this door open before the impact. What do you do?

Obstacles are the problems that stand between you and your mission. They can be hostile aliens, malfunctioning systems, collapsing stations, or even the ambitions of rival officers. To overcome an obstacle, you must act. Actions can be violent—striking with a blade, firing a blaster, or wrestling with a hostile intruder. They can be technical—patching a ruptured coolant line, bypassing a power relay, or charting a safe trajectory through a debris field. They can be social—convincing a suspicious diplomat, rallying frightened colonists, or bluffing your way past a security checkpoint.

Once you describe what you do, the GM calls for a test with a particular ability (see Chapter 4) or skill (see Chapter 5), sets the difficulty or opposition, and the dice decide the outcome. Every number rolled above 4 is a success.

There are two types of tests: An independent test has a fixed obstacle, determined by the GM. If your number of successes equals or exceeds the Ob, you succeed. A versus test pits your roll against another character or environmental feature. Whoever rolls more successes wins.

## Increasing your chances

### Hero Tokens

Extra Die: Each Hero Token spent before you roll gives one die to the acting player. You cannot spend more than two tokens in a single test.

Reroll sixes: After rolling, and if you haven't already spent 2 Hero Tokens to increase the number of dice, spending 1 token allows you to reroll all dice that came up 6. Any new sixes can be rolled again, continuing until no new sixes appear.

### Aid

Companions can help each other in tests. To help, wait until the acting player describes their action, then explain how your character lends aid.

* Extra Die: Each helper gives one die to the acting player. Let the helper roll, so we know if it was useful or not
* Abilities Help Abilities: Will helps Will, Health helps Health, Resources helps Resources, Circles helps Circles.
* Skills Help Skills: You may help with the same skill, or one listed in the “Suggested Help” section of that skill. The GM decides if it makes sense.

### Risks of Helping

If the test succeeds, all share in success. If it fails:

* The acting player suffers the full twist or condition.
* Helpers also suffer consequences: usually a lesser condition (e.g., the roller becomes Exhausted, helpers become Hungry).

Helpers cannot assist if their relevant ability or skill was reduced to 0.

## Breaking Ties

Ties happen. There are several ways to resolve them:

1. Use Hero Tokens, special gear or unique consumables that grants extra success.
2. Invoke a trait to break the tie in your opponent’s favor and receive 2 Hero Tokens for the group

If all else fails, a secondary test breaks the tie:

* If the tied skill was physical, roll Health.
* If the tied skill was social or mental, roll Will.

# Chapter Four: Abilities

Abilities are the foundation of every character. They represent raw measures of mind, body, and social reach—called upon when skill and gear are insufficient. Abilities are tested directly, or they serve as the fallback when you lack a skill.

There are two types of abilities. Raw Abilities measure personal reserves: Will represents mental resilience, while Health represents physical endurance. Social Abilities reflect external leverage: Circles represent connections and reputation, while Resources represents material assets and wealth.

## Beginner’s Luck

If you do not have the appropriate skill for a test, you may attempt it using Beginner’s Luck. Roll the ability linked to that skill—either Will or Health. But instead of a regular difficulty, double the Ob or the number of successes from the opponent. Easy tasks may still be achievable, but complex challenges will be pretty difficult.

Each Beginner’s Luck test also counts toward learning the skill. See the Skills chapter for advancement rules.

## Will

Will measures adaptability, mental strength, and determination. It governs resistance to persuasion, intimidation, psychic strain, and the emotional pressures of grief, isolation, or fear.

Rating: Typically 1–6 for humans.

Tests: Use Will to endure social or psychological pressure, or to maintain composure under duress.

## Health

Health represents physical stamina, toughness, and resilience. It governs resistance to disease, injury, fatigue, and harsh conditions.

Rating: Typically 1–6 for humans.

Tests: Use Health to endure hardship, resist illness, or overcome exhaustion in long patrols.

## Resources

Resources measure a character’s material wealth, influence, and access to goods or services. Unlike physical or mental abilities, Resources reflect social standing, credit, and the ability to borrow, trade, or call in favors. Wealth may be inherited, earned, or improvised, but in play it is always an abstraction of what the character can reasonably acquire.

Rating: 0–10.

Tests: Use Resources to buy or secure technology, services, lodging, bribes, transportation, or professional labor.

Player’s Turn: Most uses of Resources take place during the player’s turn, when purchases and arrangements can more easily be made.

Special Rules:

* Helping: Characters may assist one another with Resources tests. If the roll is taxed, all participants suffer tax. The helpers do not need to appear in the same scene.
* Home and Away: Resources reflect influence in familiar territory. When operating off-world or within a foreign power’s reach, add +1 Ob to all Resources tests.
* Buying in Bulk: For wholesale purchases, increase the obstacle by 1–2 and multiply the quantity by 10–100, depending on the venue.
* Treasure and requisitioned supplies: Treasure and equivalent resources provides bonus dice (1D–3D). Divisible wealth such as credits can be split across rolls; unique valuables such as relics cannot. Spent treasure dice are lost.
* Protection from Tax: Treasure dice spent on a test absorb tax from that roll.
* Zero Resources: If your current (taxed) resources is reduced to 0, you may only test Resources with treasure dice. Hero Tokens cannot be used.
* Abstract System: Resources do not track exact currency. Attempting to “count credits” undermines the abstraction. Instead, think of Resources as a measure of wealth, access, and reputation combined.
* Advancing Resources: Resources advance like a skill: the more you test it, the more it grows. Important: When determining the number of tests required, use the maximum rating of Resources, not the taxed/temporary one.
* Zero Max Resources: To advance Resources from 0 to 1, you need one successful test. You can only do so using Treasure.

### Failed Tests and Tax

On a failed test, Resources are taxed, temporarily reducing the exponent. Tax represents the depletion of liquid assets, overextended credit, or exhausted favors. Resources are reduced by the margin of failure.

Gift of Kindness: Instead of denying the purchase, the GM may allow the character to succeed, but applying a heavier tax. Increase the tax by 1-3 levels. The player can deny this gift, don't purchase and keep his previous tax.

### Recovering Taxed Resources

Resources do not recover automatically. They must be replenished during downtime. To do so, use a Hero Token and choose a skill that represents how the character restores their reserves (earning money, making deals, managing accounts). Test that skill with an obstacle of 1 + the number of dice lost.

Recovery: Success restores 1D of Resources, making future tests easier. Extra successes recover additional dice. The test also counts for the job’s skill advancement, as usual.

## Circles

Circles represent your reputation, contacts, and the networks you can draw upon. A high rating reflects a wide range of allies and acquaintances, even in unfamiliar regions.

* Rating: 1–10.
* Tests: Roll Circles to locate or call upon someone useful in a settlement—guides, guards, mentors, informants, smugglers, or other contacts.

## Learning a New Skill

Characters can acquire new skills during play, even if they did not begin with them. Any time you attempt an action using a skill you do not possess, you fall back on the Beginner’s Luck rules from the Overcoming Obstacles section.

When you do this, write the skill on your sheet without a rating. Each time you attempt it, mark an X beside the skill. The Xs represent your progress toward learning. It does not matter whether the attempt succeeds or fails—every test counts.

Once you have marked a number of Xs equal to six minus the attribute you rolled for Beginner’s Luck (either Health or Will), you officially learn the skill. At that point, erase the Xs and write the skill down with a rating of 1. Reaching a rating of 1 does not mean you are skilled—it means you now understand just enough to realize your own inexperience. From there, true training and practice begin.

While testing with Beginner’s Luck, do not mark tests toward advancing Will or Health.

# Chapter Six: Traits

## Trait List

Trait Table

Traits**	**Description

Ambitious+Jaded**	**You once dreamed of greatness. Maybe you still do. Maybe the dream curdled.

Bold+Obsessive**	**You leap into the unknown. Sometimes you can’t let go of what you’ve found there.

Bold+Two-Faced**	**You’re daring, and you hide behind masks. Both help you survive smuggling runs.

Brilliant+Absent-Minded**	**Your insights dazzle, but you sometimes lose track of the present.

Charismatic+Burdened**	**People look to you for leadership, but the weight of command never leaves your shoulders.

Charming+Self-Destructive**	**People love you. You might even love yourself — but you burn bridges faster than you build them.

Compassionate+Clinical**	**You heal because you care deeply — or because it’s just another problem to solve.

Connected+Wanted**	**You know the networks of the underworld — but someone is after you.

Curious+Lonely**	**You hunger for discovery, but your path has often left you isolated.

Devout+Doubtful**	**You have faith — sometimes blazing, sometimes faltering. Both make you who you are.

Enthralled+Cautious**	**Alien life enthralls you, but you know too well the dangers it can bring.

Elusive+Obsessed**	**You slip through nets, but sometimes your focus consumes you.

Hardened+Haunted**	**You’ve seen battle and carry the scars. Maybe it made you unshakable. Maybe it left you broken.

Hotshot+Steady Hand**	**You thrive on daring maneuvers, yet when it matters most, you can hold the course.

Inquisitive+Detached**	**You’re driven to uncover truth, but often forget the people behind the data.

Loyal+Reckless**	**Fiercely protective of your comrades, but sometimes you throw yourself into danger without thought.

Lucky+Desperate**	**You’ve survived by chance before. And when luck runs out, you’ll do anything.

Optimist+Greedy**	**You believe fortune favors you. Or maybe you just want more, always more.

Ruthless+Pragmatic**	**You’ll do what it takes to win — whether through cruelty or cold calculation.

Shrewd+Opportunist**	**You spot the angle in every deal. But are you clever… or just selfish?

Silver-Tongued+Compromised**	**Your words can open doors — but they may have trapped you in promises or lies.

Starwise+Jaded**	**You know the lanes, the stations, the shortcuts. You’ve also seen enough to dull your wonder.

Traditionalist+Revisionist**	**You respect the past… or want to rewrite it. Sometimes both.

Watchful+Paranoid**	**You catch details others miss. Sometimes you see threats that aren’t there.

Zealous+Burned Out**	**Once, you burned bright for a cause. The fire still smolders — or maybe only the ashes remain.

# Chapter Seven: The Mindscape

The physical galaxy is vast—kilometer-thick hulls, burning stars, diplomatic chambers, shattered moons. But beneath it, threaded through every ship, station, and civilization with the means to access it, lies a second plane of existence: a lattice of cognition, simulation, and shared memory called theMindscape.

The Mindscape is not a simple network. It is a consensual hallucination, a semi-abstract architecture maintained by Minds and navigated by sophonts. It is a parallel reality made of thought, symbol, and data—where time behaves strangely, where skills can be ingested whole, and where machines can be commanded by will alone.

For Special Circumstances operatives, the Mindscape is a weapon, a library, a training ground, and occasionally a battlefield.

## Entering the Mindscape

Characters access the Mindscape through neural interfaces, ship cores, or dedicated immersion rigs. Entry is instantaneous: a flicker in perception, a dissolving of the boundaries of the body, and then the quiet clarity of thoughtspace.

Inside, your avatar is a conceptual projection—not necessarily your physical form, but whatever shape best expresses your intent or identity. Some agents appear as themselves; others as geometric prisms, mythic beasts, or abstract icons. Form matters only when interacting with constructs that respond to symbolism.

The GM describes Mindscape environments as vividly as physical ones: infinite libraries, shifting grids, dreamlike factories, fractal cities, recursive vaults of memory, or Mind-designed spaces with impossible physics.

## The Mindchip

The Mindchip is a specialized cognitive implant—an artificial cortex designed to load, store, and execute mnemonic “grams” at speeds biological minds cannot match. In play, Mindchip is treated as an Ability, rated 1–6 like Will or Health.

Roll Mindchip to perform any of the following:

* Download and integrate a skill gram (see below)
* Access or manipulate dense data structures
* Perform high-speed calculations, simulations, or forensics
* Defend your mind against hostile code or invasive constructs
* Mindchip is also used to augment skills (see below).

## Downloading Skill-Grams

One of the most astonishing features of the Mindscape is the ability to acquire new skills nearly instantly. These are not true skills, but mnemonic templates—procedural maps that allow your character to act as if they had trained for years.

### Downloading a Skill-Gram (Mechanics)

During the Players’ Turn, an agent can Test their Mindchip to attempt downloading a new skill-gram.

Test:

Roll Mindchip, Ob 2–4 depending on the complexity of the skill:

| Skill Type             | Example skills                        | Obstacle |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Basic procedures       | Computer, Streetwise, Slug Pistol     | Ob 2     |
| Technical / Scientific | Engineering, Surgery, Physics         | Ob 3     |
| High Specialization    | Xenobiology, Demolitions, Linguistics | Ob 4     |

Success:

* You change a Skill-gram to be related to your chosen skill, effectively granting you an extra dice whenever you test this Skill. Note this bonus near your Mindchip attribute.

Limitations:

* You cannot download more than one skill-gram per Mindchip rating.
* They can be deleted or swapped voluntarily, but this requires a Mindchip test, as usual.

# Chapter Eight: Conditions

Failure has consequences. When a test goes wrong—or when the galaxy’s pressures overwhelm mind or body—your character may suffer a Condition.

Conditions represent temporary harm, distress, or depletion. They shape how an agent moves through the world: clouded judgment, frayed nerves, physical strain, or emotional wounds. They limit your effectiveness until addressed, and they tell the story of how your mission is wearing you down.

Conditions are not punishments—they’re opportunities for drama, sacrifice, clever problem-solving, and teamwork.

Conditions can affect:

* Abilities (Will, Health, Resources, Circles, Mindchip)
* Skill rolls (imposing −1D)
* Disposition at the start of combat or conflicts
* Roleplay and fiction (your character feels or behaves differently)

Conditions persist until recovered. They do not disappear between sessions. Players may willingly accept a Condition if it makes narrative sense or to avoid a worse fate. The GM may assign Conditions from failed tests, twists, or fictionally appropriate hardships.

| Condition          | Effect                                                                                 | Recovery                                                                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

Refer to this handy table after your actions have been announced. It will tell you if you need to make an independent test, a versus test or no test at all for your action. When reading, consult the table for your action on the left and your opponent’s action along the top row.

* I: Independent test. Test both actions separately; both actions can succeed or fail.
* V: Versus test. Roll skills or abilities against each other. Highest successes wins.
* —: Do not roll for your action. Your opponent rolls but you do not.
* A: Only you roll. Your opponent do not.

## Maneuver Effects

 **1 success** : -1D disadvantage to your opponent’s next action.

 **2 successes** : +2D advantage to your next action.

 **3+ successes** : Remove one of your opponent’s weapons, a piece of gear or disable a trait for the remainder of the conflict. Alternatively, you may get both results above.
